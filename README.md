# Instructions
All the code needed to replicate the results is in the Splice Junction Recognition and Visualization iPython notebook. To run it, several packages will need to be installed. The easy way to set this up is via Anaconda. If you have Anaconda installed, create a new environment using the environment.txt file, which will automatically download the required packages. Then, run `jupyter notebook` to run the iPython server.

If you don't want to run the notebook but only view the code, you can visit it inside your browser via GitHub. It will show you a snapshot of the notebook that contains outputs and results.
