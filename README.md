# Instructions
All the code needed to replicate the results is in the [Splice Junction Recognition and Visualization iPython notebook](./Splice%20Junction%20Recognition%20and%20Visualization.ipynb). To run it, several packages will need to be installed. The easiest way to set this up is via Anaconda. If you have Anaconda installed, create a new environment using the [environment.txt](./environment.txt) file, which will automatically download the required packages. Then, run `jupyter notebook` to run the iPython server.

If you don't want to run the notebook but only view the code, you can [visit it](./Splice%20Junction%20Recognition%20and%20Visualization.ipynb) inside your browser via GitHub. It will show you a snapshot of the notebook that contains outputs and results.
